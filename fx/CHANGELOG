+ The Flapjax framework exports only documented methods and procedures.

+ flapjaxInit has been enhanced to allow you to selectively export functions
  or certain classes of functions.  This facilitates interoperability with
  other JavaScript frameworks and existing code-bases.

+ The function extractId_b requires you to specify a trigger event.

+ topE has been removed.

+ insertValuesB has been removed.  It was broken and effectively a no-op.
